## Welcome To This Hands-on Lab üëãüèΩ
This is a **75-minute** instructor-led workshop session at Microsoft Ignite 2025. By the end of this lab you should have an intuitive sense for what Red Teaming is, what the Red Teaming agent does, and how to run an automated red-teaming scan locally, or in the cloud, using Azure AI Foundry.

## 1. Lab Instructions

**Instructions Link:** ++[Lab516 README](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite25-LAB516-safeguard-your-agents-with-ai-red-teaming-agent-in-azure-ai-foundry)++

Open a new private browser in your workstation. 

1. Copy the instructions link to the browser and navigate to it.
1. In the "Before You Begin" section, **Select the Microsoft AI Tour tab**
1. Leave this browser open and follow the instructions for the lab.

## 2. Azure Credentials

You will be assigned a temporary Azure subscription for this lab. Verify that the _Username_ and _Password_ credentials are not empty below. We will use them during setup.

- **Username:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username++
- **Password:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password++
- **TAP Token:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).AccessToken++

## 3. Skillable VM Credentials

The Skillable VM has a login screen (left) that we do **NOT** need to use today. However, we may need it for troubleshooting (with proctor help). The credentials below will be useful for logging in then.

- +++@lab.VirtualMachine(WRK550-Win11(NEW)).Username+++
- +++@lab.VirtualMachine(WRK550-Win11(NEW)).Password+++

## 4. Time Tracking

This Skillable page has a countdown timer (top right) that will show **Hours Remaining** for lab completion. Use this to track time left and decide if you want to do optional steps accordingly. 

- You should start with at least 1h 15min on the clock.
- You will be notified when there are 10 mins left
- When timer expires, the VM will terminate automatically!
 
## 5. Revisiting Lab at Home

By the end of this workshop, you will have a copy of the sample app in your personal GitHub profile. Revisit it at home to explore and complete sections at your own pace. 

1. You will need your own Azure subscription for this.
1. You will need to set the "Before You Begin" tab to **Self-Guided** 
1. Then continue working through the lab steps there.
