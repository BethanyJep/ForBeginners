# Zava DIY

Zava is a fictional enterprise retail organization that sells home improvement goods to DIY enthusiasts. The official [Zava DIY Dataset Plus MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-tour-26-zava-diy-dataset-plus-mcp) includes product catalog data - with 400+ products currently listed across [9+ product categories](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-tour-26-zava-diy-dataset-plus-mcp?tab=readme-ov-file#-product-categories).

For this template, the `zava/` folder is pre-populated with:

- A `products.csv` file from the original dataset repo
- A `products.json` version created from that CSV file
- An `md/` folder with markdown-based text files for each product
- A `products-paints.csv` with a curated set of 50 paints products

These were created specifically to support key workshops and curricula. If you are planning on building your own Zava scenarios, please reference and use the official [Zava DIY Dataset Plus MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-tour-26-zava-diy-dataset-plus-mcp) instead.
