# Introduction


!!! info "AZD For AI Developers: A Hands-on Workshop"
    
Want to build AI Agentic applications on Azure AI Foundry but don't know where to start? What if you could start with a fully-functioning solution architecture - then deconstruct it to understand key features and workflows - and reconstruct it with your custom data and requirements.

This is the **deconstruct and learn** approach we'll follow in this workshop. We'll use the [Getting Started With AI Agents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-agents) template with the [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd) commandline tool - to accelerate our journey from idea to infrastructure & implementation _in a reproducible and efficient way_.

**Duration:** 3-4 hours <br/>
**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate

Let's Go! ðŸš€
