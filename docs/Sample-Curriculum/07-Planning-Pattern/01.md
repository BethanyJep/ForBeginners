    In this lesson, we'll answer the following questions:

    - What is the overall goal of the task?
        - Understanding the end goal helps in breaking down the task into manageable subtasks.
    - How can the task be decomposed into smaller, manageable subtasks?
        - Identifying the subtasks is crucial for planning the sequence of actions.
    -What tools or resources are needed to complete each subtask?
        - Knowing the required tools helps in planning their invocation and integration.
    - How will the agent decide the sequence of steps?
        - Determining the decision-making process ensures the agent can dynamically adjust its actions.
    - What criteria will be used to evaluate the success of each subtask?
        - Setting evaluation criteria helps in assessing the quality and completeness of each step.
    - How will the agent handle unexpected situations or errors?
        - Planning for contingencies ensures robustness and reliability.
    - What are the performance and efficiency considerations?
        - Ensuring the process is efficient and meets performance requirements is essential for practical applications.
    - How will the agent iterate and improve its output?
        - Incorporating iterative improvement mechanisms can enhance the quality of the final result.
    - What are the potential ethical and safety implications?
        - Considering ethical and safety aspects ensures responsible and safe deployment of the AI agent.
