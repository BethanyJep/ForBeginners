# Microsoft For Beginners Template

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This README is meant as guidance for **users** of this template. When you instantiate the template to start a new project, please replace this README.md with the version found in `docs/README.md` and fill that in to reflect your topic instead. If you are retrofitting an existing repository, then simply read the guidance here to understand how to apply these tactics (and ensure your repository is connected into the larger inititaive)

This repository provides an actionable templat for delivering open-source curriculum or providing repo-hosted workshops in conjunction with Azure Samples projects, by taking advantage of the built-in GitHub Pages hosting in the source repository. 

1. The projects will use [Mkdocs Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) for the documentation setup
2. The projects will use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosted websites
3. The projects will be registered with Microsoft & kept compliant

## Personas

Each project will adhere to a consistent format for documentation to enhacne the learning experience for AI engineers and beginners alike. We expect three kinds of personas to use these projects, and want to make sure experience is optimized for all

1. **Beginner** - new to the topic - interested in concepts to code.
2. **Developer** - comfortable with code - interested in tools & techniques.
3. **AI Engineer** - building intelligent apps - interested in E2E solutions.

## Calls To Action

To complement the journey, we ask each template user to add these three calls to action to their README.md

1. [**Bookmark the Learn Collection** ðŸ“š](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/collections/7d2wswpx0d02qj) - and use it to discover other resources
