## For Beginners: Template

This project contains setup scripts and a customized version of the [get-started-with-ai-agents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-agents/tree/main) starter template for Azure AI Foundry.

Our objectives are: 

1. Create scripts to customize the base template for our 1P workshops (with Skillable)
1. Maintain a customized template for reuse in our {AZD/Models}-For-Beginners curricula
1. Maintain event-specific branches that freeze stable versions for a given workshop.

Note that this means the version of the template here may be different from the base starter template in terms of the default configuration used.

_We encourage the community to fork and extend this repository for their own Azure AI Foundry workshops or learning journeys - and file issues with bugs or feedback._

## AZD For Beginners: Workshop

Not familiar with [AZD templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/azd-templates?tabs=csharp)? Explore the new [AZD For Beginners](https://github.com/microsoft/azd-for-beginners) curriculum for a step-by-step introduction to the [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd) and fundamentals of AZD templates.

This _For Beginners Template_ project also powers the [AZD For AI Developers](https://github.com/microsoft/AZD-for-beginners/tree/main/workshop) workshop that is part of that curriculum. This of this template as a _learning sandbox_ where you can deconstruct a completely functioning template to figure out how it works. Then reconstruct it with your data, and customize it to your specific scenario or requirements!
